              I have always been passionate about nails since I was a little
              girl, when I used to do my friends' nails for fun. Now, I love to
              create beautiful nail designs for my clients, using a variety of
              techniques and products.

              I am qualified and certified in manicure, pedicure, gel, polish
              gel, KART pedicure, and nail art. I have completed several
              extensive courses and immersive workshops to keep up with the
              latest trends and innovations in nail care, all while prioritizing
              and maintaining the highest health and safety standards, and
              meticulous hygiene practices. I take hygiene incredibly seriously
              and have an unwavering commitment to never compromise on it.
